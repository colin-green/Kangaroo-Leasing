# Kangaroo: Adopt-A-Lease

## Overview
- Kangaroo is a platfrom through which users can find existing leases for living accomodations and adopt them. It brings together leaseholders or landlords and those looking for somewhere to stay for at least 2 months in the Metro Atlanta area. Simply search for a place using different criteria (leasers), or list a place whose lease is up for grabs (leaseholders).
